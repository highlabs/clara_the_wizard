## What's, is this project?

It's a straightforward trick of "magic." You will select one card in one of three piles and in the end, the chosen card will be revealed.

This project has some tests (I'm new to tests. :shame:), so you can check it in `/tests`. All the "magic" are in `/src/App.vue` component.

This project uses [DeckOfCards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) to get the cards. And all the icons and arts are from [Luiza Giannelli](https://www.behance.net/luizagiannelli)
